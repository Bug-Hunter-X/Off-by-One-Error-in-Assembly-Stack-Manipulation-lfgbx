# Off-by-One Error in Assembly Stack Manipulation

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in assembly code that can lead to unexpected behavior. The error occurs when manipulating data stored on the stack, specifically incrementing a value.  The incorrect increment leads to array index out-of-bounds or loop termination issues.

The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides the corrected version.
